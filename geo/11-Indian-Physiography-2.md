### Northern Plains of India

#### 1. Location & Formation

- **Position**: Between Himalayas (north) & Peninsular Plateau (south).
  - Extends: Punjab-Haryana → Assam (east-west ~2,400 km).
- **Formation**: Alluvial deposits brought by Himalayan rivers (Indus, Ganga, Brahmaputra & tributaries).
- **Area**: ~3,20,000 km².
- **Sub-Divisions (North to South)**:
  - **Bhabar**: Piedmont zone (Himalayan foothills); coarse pebbles/boulders; rivers disappear underground.
    - Example: Large boulders; porous → streams sink.
  - **Terai**: South of Bhabar; rivers re-emerge; marshy, forested, fertile (reclaimed for agriculture).
    - Example: Dense forests, wildlife (Dudhwa NP).

#### 2. Classification (Based on Rivers)

- **Indus Plains**: Punjab-Haryana region; highly fertile Doabs.
- **Ganga Plains**: Largest unit (Delhi to Kolkata); extremely fertile.
- **Brahmaputra Plains**: Predominantly in Assam; wide valley, heavy deposition.

##### 2.1 Doabs (Punjab Plains – Interfluves)

- Land between two rivers (Punjab = "Land of Five Rivers").
- **Key Doabs** (south to north):
  - Bist Doab: Beas-Sutlej.
  - Bari Doab: Beas-Ravi.
  - Rachna Doab: Ravi-Chenab.
  - Chaj Doab: Chenab-Jhelum.
  - Sind-Sagar Doab: Jhelum-Indus (largest).
- **Exam Tip**: Questions often ask "Doab between X & Y rivers and names of dobas are made by rivers names".

##### 2.2 Ganga Plains

- Largest & most fertile unit.
- Alluvial soil (khadar – new; bhangar – old).
- Southern tributaries (Peninsular rivers) also contribute sediment.

##### 2.3 Brahmaputra Plains (Assam Valley)

- Narrow but extremely fertile due to Brahmaputra’s massive deposition.
- World’s largest riverine island: **Majuli** (Brahmaputra, Assam).
- Heavy flooding → rich silt.

#### 3. Coastal Plains of India

- **Position**: Between Peninsular mountains (Western/Eastern Ghats) & sea coast.
- Narrow plains along coasts.

##### 3.1 Western Coastal Plain

- Narrow, rocky beaches (submerged coast).
- Sub-Divisions (north to south):
  - **Kutch Plain**: Rann of Kutch (Gujarat).
  - **Kathiawar/Konkan Plain**: Daman to Goa (Maharashtra dominant; lagoons, estuaries).
  - **Kannada Plain**: Goa to Mangalore (Karnataka).
  - **Malabar Plain**: Mangalore to Kanyakumari (Kerala; lagoons/kayals – Vembanad Lake).
- **Features**: Emerged coast → ports (Mumbai, Marmagao).

##### 3.2 Eastern Coastal Plain

- Wider, sandy beaches, deltas (emergent coast).
- Sub-Divisions (north to south):
  - **Utkal Plain**: Subarnarekha to Mahanadi (Odisha).
  - **Andhra Plain (Circar)**: Mahanadi to Krishna delta.
  - **Coromandel/Tamil Nadu Plain**: Krishna delta to Kanyakumari.
- **Features**: Deltas (Godavari, Krishna, Kaveri, Mahanadi); lagoons (Chilika, Pulicat).

##### 3.3 Significance of Coastal Plains

- Fertile deltas → agriculture.
- Major ports & fisheries.
- Monazite sands (Kerala coast) → thorium (nuclear energy).
- Backwaters/lagoons (Kerala) → tourism.

#### 4. Islands of India

- **Total Offshore Islands**: ~300.
- **Near-Coast Islands**: 1,382.

##### 4.1 Andaman & Nicobar Islands (Bay of Bengal)

- **Origin**: Volcanic (plate collision).
- **Total Islands**: ~572 (only ~38 inhabited).
- **Division**:
  - North Andaman.
  - Middle Andaman.
  - South Andaman.
  - Little Andaman (separated from South by **Duncan Passage**).
  - Nicobar Group (separated from Little Andaman by **10° Channel**).
- **Key Points**:
  - Capital: Port Blair (South Andaman).
  - Cellular Jail (“Kala Pani”) – South Andaman.
  - Highest peak: **Saddle Peak** (North Andaman).
  - Coco Strait: Between North Andaman & Myanmar’s Coco Islands.
- **Additional Examples** (knowledge):
  - Barren Island: India’s only active volcano.
  - Narcondam: Extinct volcano.

##### 4.2 Lakshadweep (Arabian Sea)

- **Origin**: Coral atolls.
- **Total Islands**: 36.
- **Area**: 32 km².
- **Latitudinal Extent**: 8°–12°N (8° Channel south; 12° Channel north).
- **Key Islands**:
  - Kavaratti (capital).
  - Agatti (only airport).
  - Minicoy (southernmost; separated by 9° Channel).
- **Occupation**: Fishing, coconut, tourism.
- **Smallest UT**.

##### 4.3 Other Islands

- **New Moore Island**: Disputed (India-Bangladesh); submerged; natural gas potential.
- **Diu & Daman Islands**: Off Gujarat.
- **Abdul Kalam Island (Wheeler Island)**: Off Odisha (missile testing site).
