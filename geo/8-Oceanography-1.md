### Oceanography Lecture Notes

#### 1. Introduction to Oceanography

- **Definition**: Scientific and geographical study of everything inside the oceans (seas/samudra).
- **Scope of this Lecture**:
  - Relief features inside the ocean (ocean floor topography).
  - Properties of ocean water (salinity, temperature).
  - Movement of ocean water (currents, tides).

#### 2. Importance of Studying Oceans

- Oceans cover **71%** of Earth's surface → Earth called **Blue Planet**.
- **Example**: Pacific Ocean covers almost one entire face of Earth.
- **Reasons**:
  - **Resources**: Fish (food), corals, minerals, oil/gas.
  - **Navigation**: Waterways essential for trade/transport.
  - **Food Security**: Marine animals (sea lions, walruses) for coastal populations.
  - **Energy**:
    - Tidal energy.
    - Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) – uses temperature difference between surface and depth.
  - **Climate Influence**: Moderates climate (e.g., Mumbai – moderate vs Delhi – extreme due to proximity to sea).
  - **Carbon Sink**: Corals and marine plants absorb atmospheric CO₂.

#### 3. Formation of Oceans (Degassing Process)

- Early Earth: Volcanoes released gases (sulfur, nitrogen, carbon, water vapor).
- Water vapor formed clouds → condensation → precipitation (rain).
- Rainwater accumulated in low-lying areas → formed oceans.

#### 4. Oceans on Earth

- Total: **5 major oceans** (cover 71% water).
  - Pacific (largest).
  - Atlantic.
  - Indian.
  - Southern.
  - Arctic (smallest).
- Common exam questions: Straits, canals (Suez, Malacca), bordering countries (e.g., Caspian Sea & Black Sea).

#### 5. Water Distribution on Earth

- Total freshwater: **2.4509%** of Earth's water.
  - Lakes/ponds (e.g., Great Lakes): ~0.5060%.
  - Ice caps/glaciers (poles & mountains): **1.9250%**.
  - Rivers: very less (~0.0001%).
  - Ocean - 97.6%

#### 6. Relief Features of Ocean Floor (Topography)

- **Structure from Coast to Deep Ocean**:
  1. **Continental Shelf** → Continental Slope → Continental Rise → Abyssal Plain → Mid-Oceanic Ridge/Seamounts → Trenches.
- **Major Features (by size – largest to smallest)**:
  - Abyssal Plains (70-75% of ocean floor) – flat deep plains.
  - Continental Shelf.
  - Continental Slope.
  - Continental Rise.
  - Mid-Oceanic Ridges.
- **Minor Features**:
  - Trenches (deepest).
  - Seamounts (underwater volcanic mountains), Sea hills.
  - Guyots (flat-topped seamounts – eroded by waves).
  - Submarine Canyons (like waterfalls on slope).
  - Islands.

##### 6.1 Continental Shelf

- Submerged part of continent up to depth ~100-200 m (100 fathoms).
- Gentle slope: 1°-2°.
- Width varies:
  - Narrow where high mountains near coast (e.g., Pacific – Rockies/Andes).
  - Wide where plains (e.g., Siberia – up to 1500 km in Arctic Ocean).
- **India**:
  - Western shelf wider (due to subsidence/faulting).
  - Eastern shelf narrower.
- **Significance**:
  - Sunlight penetrates → rich marine life → fishing grounds (e.g., Dogger Bank, North Sea).
  - Fossil fuels (oil/gas) from decayed organisms.

##### 6.2 Continental Slope

- Steep slope after shelf (sharp drop).
- Depth: 200-3500 m.
- High gradient.
- Contains submarine canyons.

##### 6.3 Deep Sea Plains (Abyssal Plains)

- Depth: 3000-6000 m.
- No sunlight → dark zone.
- Pelagic deposit.
- Covers 75% area of ocean.

##### 6.4 Mid-Oceanic Ridges & Seamounts

- Volcanic ridges in ocean centre → lava outflow → plate divergence.
- Guyots are if sea mountains go flat on top because of waves.

##### 6.5 Islands

- **Oceanic Islands**:
  - Volcanic (from ocean volcanism).
  - Coral (from corals).
- **Continental Islands**: Tectonic separation from continents.
- **Riverine Islands**: Formed by river deposition.
  - Largest: **Majuli** (Brahmaputra River, Assam, India).

#### 7. Properties of Ocean Water

- Main: **Salinity** and **Temperature**.
- Impact: Coastal climate, flora/fauna (halophytes in saline, normal plants in fresh).

##### 7.1 Salinity

- **Definition**: Total dissolved salts (grams) in 1 kg seawater (expressed in ‰ – parts per thousand).
- Average: **35‰** (33-37‰). It impacts physical property of water.
- **Composition**:
  - Sodium Chloride (NaCl): 77.8% (~27.2 g/kg).
  - Magnesium Chloride: 10.8%. (3.8‰)
  - Magnesium Sulphate: 4.7%.
  - Others minor.
- **Why Salty? Sources**:
  - Rivers bring sediments/salts.
  - Mid-oceanic ridge volcanism (minerals).
  - Land volcanism (ash/magma into sea).
  - Dust from hot deserts/tropical cyclones.
  - Acid rain (CO₂ + H₂O → carbonic acid → salts remain after evaporation).

##### 7.2 Factors Affecting Salinity

- **Evaporation**: ↑ evaporation → ↑ salinity (fresh water evaporates, salts remain).
  - Example: Thali with salty water in sun → water reduces, salinity increases.
- **Precipitation**: ↑ rainfall → ↓ salinity (adds fresh water).
- **River Influx**: Adds fresh water → ↓ salinity (short term); sediments → ↑ salinity (long term).
- **Ice Melting**: Adds fresh water → ↓ salinity.
- **India Example**: Bay of Bengal lower salinity (many rivers like Ganga, Mahanadi); Arabian Sea higher (fewer rivers).

##### 7.3 Distribution of Salinity

- **Horizontal**:
  - Decreases from equator to poles (generally).
  - Highest in tropics (20°-40°N/S) due to high evaporation, low rainfall.
  - High in enclosed seas (Red Sea, Mediterranean ~36-40‰).
- **Highest Salinity Places**:
  - Lake Van (Turkey): ~330‰.
  - Dead Sea (Israel-Jordan): ~238‰.
  - Great Salt Lake (USA): ~220‰.
- **Vertical**: Increases with depth (lower saline water floats above higher saline).
- **Halocline**: Layer where salinity sharply changes.

##### 7.4 Temperature

- **Specific Heat**: High for water → heats/cools slowly → moderates climate.
- **Factors**:
  - Latitude: Higher at equator, lower at poles.
  - Uneven land distribution.
  - Prevailing winds (warm winds ↑ temp, cold ↓).
  - Ocean currents (warm currents ↑, cold ↓).
  - Local weather (clouds/rain ↓ temp).

##### 7.5 Distribution of Temperature

- **Horizontal**: Decreases from equator to poles.
  - Highest in enclosed tropical seas (land heats water via conduction).
- **Vertical**:
  - Maximum at surface (direct insolation).
  - Ocean zones:
    - Photic zone (sunlight penetrates ~200 m).
    - Aphotic zone (no light, colder).
  - **Thermocline**: Layer where temperature sharply declines.
