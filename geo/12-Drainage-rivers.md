# Rivers and Lakes of India - Short Notes

1. **Drainage Systems (Introduction)**

   - Definition: Flow of water through channels → network = Drainage System.
   - Influencing Factors: Rock hardness (hard → less erosion), slope (gentle → meandering; steep → straight), water quantity (more → wider channels), tributary pattern.

2. **Drainage Patterns**

   - Dendritic: Tree-like (Ganga system).
   - Rectangular/Trellis: Right-angle joins (hard rocks).
   - Radial: Outward from hill (Amarkantak – Narmada, Son, Johila).
   - Parallel: Parallel tributaries.
   - Centripetal: Inward to lake (Aral Sea example).
   - Centrifugal (Radial Outward): Opposite of centripetal.
   - Barbed: Tributaries join opposite to main flow direction.

3. **Classification (Origin/Location)**
   - Himalayan Rivers: Perennial (snow + rain-fed).
   - Peninsular Rivers: Seasonal (rain-fed; check dams/reservoirs).
