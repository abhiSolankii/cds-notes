### Physiography of India

#### 1. Introduction to Physiography

- **Definition**: Scientific study of physical features (mountains, plateaus, plains, etc.).

#### 2. Location of India

- **Quadrant**: North-Eastern quadrant (north of Equator, east of Prime Meridian).
- **Latitudinal Extent** (Mainland): 8°4'N to 37°6'N.
