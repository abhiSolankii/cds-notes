### Introduction to Climatology

- Climatology: Study of atmosphere science (Atmospheric Science).
- Weather vs Climate:
  - Weather: Short-term (small time & area) changes in elements like rainfall, temperature, pressure, humidity, clouds.
  - Climate: Long-term (usually >21–30 years, larger area) average of same elements.
  - Key difference: Time duration & spatial scale.

### Atmosphere

- Atmosphere: Gaseous envelope surrounding Earth; protects life, no outer boundary (fades into space).
- Total height: ~29,000 km.
- Effective/active atmosphere (where weather occurs): Up to ~29 km (focus area); 97% mass within ~25–29 km.

#### Origin of Atmosphere

- Early Earth: No atmosphere; very hot, frequent volcanoes.
- Volcanic eruptions released gases: H₂O (water vapour), CO, CO₂, SO₂, N₂.
- Earth cooled → gravitational force developed → trapped these gases.
- Oxygen (O₂) not initially free; came later via cyanobacteria (anaerobic respiration: CO₂ intake → O₂ release).
- O₂ percentage gradually increased to 21% (photosynthesis continued).

#### Components of Atmosphere

1. **Gases**:

   - Constant Gases (fixed %): N₂ (78%), O₂ (21%), Argon, Neon, etc.
   - Variable Gases (changing %): CO₂, O₃ (ozone), CH₄ (methane).
   - Uses:
     - O₂: Respiration (breathing) & combustion (burning; nothing burns without O₂).
     - N₂: Plants use as ammonia for growth.
     - CO₂: Plants use for photosynthesis; greenhouse gas (traps heat → global warming).
       - Sources of increase: Smog, industries, automobiles, deforestation (reduces CO₂ absorption).
     - Ozone (O₃): In lower stratosphere; protects from harmful UV rays (measured in Dobson Units).
       - Ozone hole (Antarctica): Caused by CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons from refrigerators, ACs).
       - Solution: Montreal Protocol (1987, signed in Canada; 16 Sept → International Ozone Day); banned CFCs → hole recovering.

2. **Water Vapour**:

   - 0.5% to 5% by volume.
   - Climatically very important (greenhouse gas).
   - Source: Evaporation from water bodies (depends on temperature & surface area).
   - Higher near equator (perpendicular sunlight → more evaporation); lower near poles (slanting rays).
   - Tropical: ~2.6%; 50° latitude: ~0.9%; 70° latitude: ~0.2%.
   - 99% water vapour remains up to 5 km height.
   - Acts as greenhouse gas (traps heat).

3. **Dust Particles** (Solid Particles):
   - Include PM10, PM2.5, smoke, volcanic ash, aerosols.
   - Scattering of solar radiation:
     - Sky appears blue (daytime scattering).
     - Red/orange at sunrise/sunset.
   - Hygroscopic nuclei: Water vapour condenses around dust → cloud formation.

### Structure of Atmosphere

- Divided into concentric layers based on temperature & density variations.
- Density highest near surface; decreases with height.
- Layers (from surface upward):

1. **Troposphere** (Lowest & most important):

   - Height: Varies – higher at equator (~18 km), lower at poles (~8 km) due to heating & convection.
   - All weather phenomena occur here (rain, clouds, storms).
   - Zone of mixing (convection currents).
   - Temperature decreases with height: Normal Lapse Rate (~6.5°C per km). Highest point is Tropopause.
   - Temperature inversion possible in winters (cold air near surface, warm above).

2. **Stratosphere**:

   - Height: ~15–50 km.
   - Temperature increases with height (due to ozone absorbing UV rays).
   - No weather phenomena.
   - Contains ozone layer (protects from UV).
   - Sometimes nacreous/mother-of-pearl clouds (iridescent, high altitude; no rain).

3. **Mesosphere**:

   - Height: ~50–80 km.
   - Transition zone.
   - Temperature decreases; coldest point (mesopause: ~-90°C).
   - Meteors burn here (visible as shooting stars).

4. **Thermosphere** (Divided into):

   - Height: ~80–640 km.
   - Temperature increases sharply till the Sun.
   - Ionosphere (within thermosphere): Contains ions (D, E, F, G layers).
     - Reflects radio waves (better at night when ions closer).
     - Daytime: Ions spread → fluctuations in signals.
   - Auroras occur here (charged solar particles interact with magnetic field).

5. **Exosphere** (Outermost):
   - Upper limit; atmosphere fades into space.

- Boundaries:
  - Tropopause (top of troposphere).
  - Stratopause (top of stratosphere).
  - Mesopause (top of mesosphere; coldest).
- Karman Line: ~100 km; divides lower atmosphere from space.

#### Aurora Phenomenon

- Caused by solar flares/winds (charged particles) attracted by Earth's magnetic field (due to iron-nickel core).
- Northern Hemisphere: Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights).
- Southern Hemisphere: Aurora Australis (Southern Lights).
- Beautiful colourful displays in polar skies.

### Previous Year Questions (Discussed)

- Latitude indicates temperature (higher latitude → cooler).
- Most weather phenomena in troposphere.
- Limnology: Scientific study of lakes & ponds.
- Narrow land strip connecting two larger landmasses: Isthmus (opposite: Strait for water bodies).
