### Geomorphology

### Key Topics Covered

#### 1. **Introduction to CDS Geography**

- Geography and Environment together contribute approximately 24-25 questions out of 120 in CDS exams.
- Emphasis on understanding question patterns, particularly scenario-based questions (e.g., river crossings during journeys, honeymoon destinations based on climatic preferences).
- Focus on conceptual clarity rather than rote memorization (e.g., river origins vs. practical river crossing knowledge).

#### 2. **Universe and Cosmology**

- **Origin of the Universe:** Explained via the **Big Bang Theory (By Georges Lemaître in 1927)** (13.6 billion years ago), involving expansion from a tiny, dense dot. Evidence was given by **Edwin Hubble**.
- The universe consists of energy, physical matter, and time.
- Within 3 lakh years, Temp dropped to 4500K. Condensation took place, stars and planets formed.
- Introduction to **light year** as a unit of cosmic distance.
- A light-year is a unit of distance, not time, representing how far light travels in a vacuum in one Julian year (365.25 days). It's an enormous length, \(9.46\times 10^{12}\) km, used to measure vast distances between celestial objects in astronomy.
- Structure hierarchy: Universe → Galaxy clusters → Milky Way Galaxy → Solar System (In Orion arm) → Earth → Continents → Countries → States → Cities.
- The Milky Way galaxy houses the solar system, centered not on the Sun but on the galactic core.

  - Latitude influences climate zones: Tropics (hot), Temperate, and Polar (cold).
  - Torrid Zone (around 0°) and Frigid Zone at far north and far south. Torrid Zone are generally hot and temp keeps decreasing as we move towards Frigiz Zone due to less sunlight. Temprate zone lies between them.

- Seismic waves:
  - **Primary (P) waves:** Travel through solids, liquids, and gases.
  - **Secondary (S) waves:** Travel only through solids.
- Earth's layers affect seismic wave velocity and direction, creating zones like the **shadow zone** where waves are not detected.
